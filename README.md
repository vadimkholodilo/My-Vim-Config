My configuration for vim
# How to apply
1. If you want to sync your system buffer and vim's buffer, you'll need to install vim-gtk3 package on Debian-based systems.
I don't know what to do with it on Windows though.
2. Install a plugin manager called Vim-plug from this Github repo: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
3. Copy my .vimrc to your home directory
4. Run vim and execute ```:PlugInstall``` to install all plugins listed in .vimrc
